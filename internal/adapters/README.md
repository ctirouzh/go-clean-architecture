# **Interface Adapters**
The interface adapters are responsible for **implementing domain and application services**(interfaces) by integrating with specific frameworks/providers. They belong to the **infrastructure** layer.

For example, we can use a SQL provider to implement a domain repository or integrate with an email/SMS provider to implement a Notification service.
